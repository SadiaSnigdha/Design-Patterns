// Scenario:
// You have two classes, `OnlineOrder` and `OfflineOrder`, which implement different methods for the same process,
// but they share similar concepts. Due to their differing interfaces, it becomes difficult to handle orders 
// in a unified way. For instance, processing the payment for each type of order requires distinct methods, 
// which increases the complexity and introduces duplication.
//
// Task for Students:
// Refactor the code so that both `OnlineOrder` and `OfflineOrder` share a common interface for the payment 
// processing methods. Extract the common behaviors into an abstract class or interface, ensuring the same method 
// signature for both types of orders. 
// Apply the Extract Interface or Move Method refactoring techniques.

    void processPayment(double amount);
